### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸš€

I started my programming journey when I got introduced to Fortran by my mother.
She walked me through making a simple calculator, and it sparked an interest in programming.
Even though I've long forgotten how to program in Fortran, my love for programming and mathematics has 
been a constant in my life!

At the moment, I'm looking for opportunities in any C-style language as that is what my education was in.
My personal projects are all tackled in these languages. The choice of language depends on the task at hand!
